Many pet owners have events come up in their lives that force them to make big changes - a job loss requiring them to relocate or downsize, an allergy development, having kids, or simply longer hours at work. Any of these can make having a pet seem irresonsible or unmanagable.  Rather than leave their pet home alone all day, or force a Great Dane to live in a tiny apartment, pet owners would rather give up their beloved pet to someone who can take better care of their animal. 

This is where "Petter Life" comes into play!  With "Petter Life," pet owners looking to give their pet up for adoption have a place to connect with people looking for a pet.  They can upload info about their pet, and get connected with interested people.  

Yay, a "petter" life for everyone!

This was a group effort by Chris Meissner, Rachel Wagschal, Kim Mulligan, and Suzanna Akins.
